# Automated-Document-Processing-for-BFSI
Banks and insurance companies in India process millions of documents daily, including KYC forms (PAN, Aadhaar, Voter ID), cheque images, bank statements, loan applications, insurance claims, and property documents in multiple regional languages. Manual processing leads to long turnaround times, human errors, increased risk of fraud, and low scalability. Which is why I want to develop a platform that automates document ingestion, classification, information extraction, and validation using machine learning.
